# Deep Learning with PyTorch

So am reading this book, Deep Learning with PyTorch by Eli Stevens, Luca Antiga, and Thomas Viehmann
published by Manning Publications.

So i go to their [github](https://github.com/deep-learning-with-pytorch/dlwpt-code/tree/master).

And instead of forking it, i want to type it myself, and download needed files just as needed,
so i can understand it a bit better.

While doing so, i could not install their requirements.txt. Turns out that it outdated.
So i just delete the version, and leave  just the package, and deal  with changing package.

Thats why i public this, hope this will help some people.
